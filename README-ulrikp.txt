These were produced by:

1) Sifting through Dr. Marice A. Robinson's parsed Byzantine Majority
text (dated November 9, 2010), correlating Strong's numbers with the
parts of speech derived from the parsing tag as above.

2) Adding the correct part of speech in the 25 cases where that
particular Strong's number was not present in the Byzantine Majority
parsed text.



This lexicon, derived from Jeff Dodson's hard work, is in the Public
Domain, just like Jeff Dodson's lexicon.
