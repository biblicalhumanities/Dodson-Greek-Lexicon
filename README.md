Jeffrey Dodson's Greek Lexicon
===============================

This repository is based on Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen's conversion of
Jeffrey Dodson's lexicon.  See README-ulrikp.txt for details on
Ulrik's work.

We have converted the data to XML, and are placing it in a repository

This lexicon, in all of its forms, is in the public domain.
